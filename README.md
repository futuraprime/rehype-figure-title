# rehype-figure-title

This is a simple rehype plugin to transform images into figures while using the _title_ (not the alt text) as a caption. It draws _heavily_ on [rehype-figure](https://github.com/josestg/rehype-figure)

## Install

```sh
npm install rehype-figure-title
```

## What it does

This plugin will transform all your images into `<figure>` tags. So...

```md
![Alt Text](./img.jpg)
```

...becomes...

```html
<figure class="rehype-figure-title">
  <img src="./img.jpg" alt="A figure" />
</figure>
```

All well and good. But what if you want captions? It's poor practice to just use alt tagsâ€”those should be descriptions of the image for people who can't see it. But there's another standard way to associate text with an image in markdown: the title. Titles are relatively useless on images (they provide a browser-based tooltip that appears fitfully on hover, _also_ gets read out by some screen readers, and is basically useful only for [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/)). So this hijacks the title field:

```md
![Alt text](./img.jpg "The caption")
```

...becomes...

```html
<figure class="rehype-figure-title">
  <img src="./img.jpg" alt="A figure" />
  <figcaption>The caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

That's pretty much it.

## How to use it

Insert it into your toolchain like any other rehype plugin:

```js
import rehypeFigureTitle from 'rehype-figure-title';

function compile(markdownIn) {
  return unified()
    .use(remark)
    .use(remark2rehype)
    .use(rehypeFigureTitle, { className: /* optional class name for figures */ ""})
    .process(...);
}
```
